In this assignment, I am going to create Weatber Dashboard. The weather dashboard allows you to search a city and puts the current weather, UV Index, and the next 5 Day Forecast. The searched city is saved to local storage and is able to be clicked to reseach.

## Instructions

* In a file called `script.js`

  1. I created a function to call an API. I used the jQuery AJAX method to make requests to server-side APIs.

  2. Depending on the UV Index the color of the number will turn green or red.

  3. When the user searches a city the city saves to local storage and is able to be clicked to research the city's forcast even when the page is refreshed or exited.
